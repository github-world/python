Violent activities carried out by radical protester in Hong Kong are "purely Nazi"actions,
observes said on Wednesday after the rioters' attack on a reporter and a mainland traveller Tuesday midnight at Hong Kong international Airport,which triggered outrage across the mainland.

Hong Kong airport authorities said Wednesday they have obtained an interim injunction from the court,forbidding anyone from deliberately or intentionally obstructing or interfering with the normal use of the airport.
