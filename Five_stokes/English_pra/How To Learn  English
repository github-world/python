How to Learn English
Learning to speak English can be diffcult,but don't give up! With enough practice and the right resouces,you can start speaking English confidently.

Part 1:Improving Your Spoken Engilsh
1 Speak a little English every day.The absolute best way to learn any new language is just to speak it . It doesn't matter if you only kown five English words or if you're prectically fluent--speaking English with another person is the fastest,most effctive method of improving.
--Don't wait until you "fell more comfortable"speaking in English -- you probably won't reach that level for a long time,so push youself outside of your comfort zone and start speaking English today.You'll be amazed at how quickly your languge skills improve.

--Find a native English speaker who is willing to spend some time speaking English with you --you may be able to offer them a language exchange,where they spend 30 minutes speaking English with you and spend 30 minutes speaking your native language with them .
-- If you live in an English-speaking country ,you can practice by starting simple conversations with the people you meet,whether it's saying "hello" to a  shopkeeper or asking a stranger for directions.

2.Work on your pronunciation.Even if you have an acceptable grasp of the English language,with good grammar and an extensive vocabulary ,native English speakers may find you very difficult to understand if you don't work on your pronunciation.
--Correct,clear pronuciation is essential if you really want to improve you level of English .Listen closely to how native English speakers pronounce certain words and sounds and sounds and do your best to copy them .
-- Pay particular attention to any sounds that you are unfamilliar with or that do not exist in your native tongue.For example,some people have difficulty pronouncing the "r"sound,as it does not exist in their native language,while other people have difficulty with certain consonant clusters,such as the "th" sound.
--Be aware that the prounciation of certain English words varies greatly depending on the part of the world it's spoken in .For example,American English is very diffierent from British English.If you intend to travel to or live in an English-speaking country.this is something you should take into account when learning how to prouounce certain certain words.
3.Expand your vocabulary and use idiomatic phrases.The wider your vocabulary and the more English phrases you learn,the easier speaking English will become.
--Again ,spending time with native English speakers will help you to pick up on common vocabulary and phrases in a natural way .Although reading ,watching Engilsh TV and listending to the new is also beneficial.
--Once you have learned a new word or phrases,you should make an effort to use it in a sentence--this is the best way to commit it to memory.
--Another easy way to commit new words to memory is to make labels for everyday household items and stick them around your hose or apartment ,Then every time you use the kettle or look in the mirror,you will see the English word for these items staring back at you .
--You should also start a notebook of idiomatic phrases that English speakers use all the time.Some examples include"
"it's raining cats and dogs"(raning havily),to be on "cloud nine"(to be very happy)or saying something is a "piece of cake"（when something is very easy）.Sprinking these kinds of phraese into your conversation will bring your level of English up several notches.
